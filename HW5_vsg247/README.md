## Assignment 1
We worked on the citibike data, to analyse which types of distributions would be good fit for the distribution of the riders' age. I analyzed a Normal (KS, AD and KL tests), a Lognormal (KS and KL tests), and a Gumbel-L (KS and KL tests) distribution.  

I worked with Richard, Avikal, Hrafnkell, Kristi, Luis Fernando, Adrian, Geoff and Adriano, discussing the best way to perform our tests and to interpret our results. 



## Assignment 2

We analysed income data segregated by gender and by ethnicity in order to better understand income inequality. 

I worked with Richard, Christian, Luis Fernando, Kristi and Adriano, discussing specific steps from getting the data, processing the data and plotting the results. 



## Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis 

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

(discussed the first experimental setup with Kristi, Richard and Adriano)

### - Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? 

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Consideration about the experimental setup: Test sample does the same exercise routine as the control sample, but, besides that, has a controlled diet under that period.
    
- words:    

$$H_0:$$ People on diet had a Fat Loss lower than or equal to the people who were only on the exercise routine.

'$H_a:$' People on diet had a Fat Loss greater than the people who were only on the exercise routine.

- formulae:

'$$H_0: FatLoss_{diet+exercise}\leq FatLoss_{exercise}$$'

$$H_a: FatLoss_{diet+exercise} > FatLoss_{exercise}$$

$$\alpha = 0.05$$

### - Do American trust the president?

POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23).
Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

 - words:

$H_0:$ Percentage of Americans that trust the president ('Yes') is lower than or equal to the percentage of Americans that don't trust the president ('No').

$H_a:$ Percentage of Americans that trust the president ('Yes') is higher than the percentage of Americans that don't trust the president ('No').

- formulae:

$H_0: P_{Yes} \leq P_{No}$

$H_a: P_{Yes} > P_{No}$

$\alpha = 0.05$

### - Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. 

Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

- words:

$H_0:$ Cessation rate within the group using the nicotine patches is lower than or equal to the cessation rate within the group using the placebo. 

$H_a:$ Cessation rate within the group using the nicotine patches is highr than the cessation rate within the group using the placebo.

- formulae:

$H_0: Cessation_{nicotine} \leq Cessation_{placebo}$

$H_a: Cessation_{nicotine} > Cessation_{placebo}$

$\alpha = 0.05$

### - Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. 

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

- words:

$H_0:$ For a given age, children of moms who didn't smoke during pregnancy have an IQ lower than or equal to the IQ of children of moms who did smoke during pregnancy. 

$H_a:$ For a given age, children of moms who didn't smoke during pregnancy have an IQ higher than the IQ of children of moms who did smoke during pregnancy.

- formulae:

$H_0: IQ^{age}_{non-smkM} \leq IQ^{age}_{smkM}\enspace; \quad age = 1, 2, 3, 4.$

$H_a: IQ^{age}_{non-smkM} > IQ^{age}_{smkM} \enspace; \quad age = 1, 2, 3, 4.$

$\alpha = 0.05$
