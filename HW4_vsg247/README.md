## Assignment 1
We had to make a review of a previous assignment of one of our colleagues, to evaluate how they had formulated their Null and Alternative Hypotheses and whether the data was already ready to perform the analysis.  


## Assignment 2

I worked with Richard (rav220) and Adrian (akd361) on fiinding an example of the Chi-square test.
It took us a while to find one where the chi-square test was more clearly stated, but we ended up finding this one. We discussed a little bit about whether the representation in percentages in Figure 4 indicated that the dependent variable was actually continuous, but ended up agreeing that that was not the case.

Afterwards, we found the multiple regression article and discussed over e-mail about the more appropriate way to fill the table.

## Assignment 3

We performed two different analyses on data from the Hard to Employ program in NY in order to reproduce some of the results that they already had about the efficacy of their program. 
For each of the Hypotheses tested we used the chi-square test and a Z-test. 

I compared and discussed my results with Danny (df_1383), Avikal (as10724) and Chenxi (cc5219).


## Assignment 4

We performed three different analyses on the Citibike data comparing the age of male and female riders. 
we had to clean the data and formulate the hypothesis we were testing with each of these three analyses: K-S Test, Pearson's Correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation coefficient. 

I worked with Danny (df_1383), Avikal (as10724). Danny helped me understand the two different ways to interpret the K-S test results.
